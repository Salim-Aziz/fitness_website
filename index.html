                Functional Training
    
            </h2>
            <p>
                Functional training is a style of exercise focused on building strength <br> and coordination to improve daily activities and overall physical performance. <br> Unlike traditional weightlifting, which often isolates specific muscles, <br> functional training involves compound movements that engage multiple <br> muscle groups, mimicking real-life motions. Exercises like squats, lunges, <br> and kettlebell swings improve balance, flexibility, and core stability, helping to <br> reduce the risk of injuries and enhancing endurance. Suitable for all fitness levels, functional training promotes a balanced, strong, and more resilient body.
